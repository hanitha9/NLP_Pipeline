# NLP Assignment - Part A: Task Extraction and Categorization

## Overview
This project implements an NLP pipeline to extract tasks from unstructured text and categorize them into meaningful groups. The solution uses a heuristic-based approach with SpaCy for basic NLP tasks and K-means clustering with TF-IDF embeddings for categorization. No large language models (LLMs) or annotated datasets are used, adhering to the assignment constraints.

### Objective
- Extract tasks/action items from a paragraph, including:
  - **Mandatory**: The action to be performed.
  - **Good to Have**: The person responsible and deadline (if present).
- Categorize tasks into useful groups (e.g., "Errands," "Chores").

### Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Libraries:
  - `spacy` (with `en_core_web_sm` model)
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `numpy`
  - `json`
- Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install spacy scikit-learn numpy
  python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
 # File Structure
part_a_solution.py: Main Python script containing the complete solution.
# How to Run
Clone or Download:
Save part_a_solution.py to your local machine.
Install Dependencies:
Run the commands above to install required libraries.
Execute the Script:
python part_a_solution.py
The script processes a sample input and outputs the results in JSON format, followed by validation and insights.
# Implementation Details

   # Steps
```
Preprocessing (clean_text())
Removes special characters (except ., ,, !, ?) and normalizes spaces.
Stop word removal is optional and disabled to preserve task context (e.g., "has," "should").
Task Extraction (extract_tasks())
Uses heuristics: identifies sentences with a root verb and task-indicating keywords (e.g., "buy," "clean," "should").
Extracts persons via NER, proper nouns, or pronoun resolution (e.g., "He" → "Rahul").
Detects deadlines with SpaCy NER and regex (e.g., "by 5 pm," "tomorrow").
Categorization (generate_embeddings() and categorize_tasks())
Generates TF-IDF embeddings for task sentences.
Clusters tasks using K-means (max 4 clusters).
Aligns clusters to categories ("Chores," "Errands," "Work/Studies," "Meetings") with a heuristic based on task content.
Output
Returns a JSON structure with tasks, persons, deadlines, categories, and embeddings.
```
# Sample Input
text = """Rahul wakes up early every day. He goes to college in the morning and comes back at 3 pm.
At present, Rahul is outside. He has to buy the snacks for all of us. Rahul should clean the room by 5 pm today."""
# Sample Output
{
    "tasks": [
        {
            "task": "He has to buy the snacks for all of us.",
            "person": "Rahul",
            "deadline": null,
            "category": "Errands"
        },
        {
            "task": "Rahul should clean the room by 5 pm today.",
            "person": "Rahul",
            "deadline": "5 pm today",
            "category": "Chores"
        }
    ],
    "embeddings": [...]
}
# Validation
Manual Validation:
Compared computed tasks against a manually curated sample:
Task 1: "He has to buy..." → Matches (person: "Rahul," deadline: null, category: "Errands").
Task 2: "Rahul should clean..." → Matches (person: "Rahul," deadline: "5 pm today," category: "Chores").
Result: Both tasks match perfectly.
# Insights and Challenges
Stop Word Removal: Enabling it removed key words like "has," breaking task detection. I disabled it to prioritize accuracy.
Category Swapping: Initial K-means clustering swapped categories (e.g., "buy" as "Chores"). Fixed with a heuristic to align clusters with task content.
Pronoun Resolution: Tracking the last person (e.g., "Rahul" for "He") was challenging but effective with a last_person variable.
Balancing Preprocessing: Ensuring preprocessing didn’t disrupt task extraction was a key challenge.
